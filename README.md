# one-class-svm-rnn
Implementation for RNN with one-class-SVM as classifier

Experimental implementation as proof-of-concept

Simple example using MNIST for RNN

Based on RNN example:

https://github.com/monikkinom/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/notebooks/3_NeuralNetworks/recurrent_network.ipynb

and multi-class SVM for CNN:

https://github.com/dlmacedo/SVM-CNN


c++ implementation for one-class-svm for new layer can be either 

libsvm

or this code that only offers RBF kernel for the one-class-SVM
